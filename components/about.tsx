      My journey into front-end development began organically â€“ starting my career as a content writer. I discovered a passion for creating engaging content and even built a blog on WordPress. However, encountering limitations led me to explore custom HTML and CSS, opening the door to front-end development. Recognizing my aptitude for creativity and problem-solving, I found a perfect fit in front-end engineering. Combining these skills has proven to be a successful formula for delivering innovative and effective solutions in this dynamic field.
